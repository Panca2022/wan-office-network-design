# 🌐 Small Business Network Design using WAN (IPv4 & IPv6)

## 📖 Overview

This project showcases the design, implementation, and documentation of a **small business network** connecting multiple branch offices to a **central headquarters** using **Wide Area Network (WAN)** technology. The network uses both **IPv4 and IPv6 addressing**, and is designed to be **robust, secure, and scalable** for future expansion.

---

## 🧠 Key Objectives

- Connect multiple local offices to a central HQ using WAN
- Apply both IPv4 and IPv6 addressing schemes
- Ensure scalability, security, and fault tolerance
- Meet the minimum network requirements (100 hosts, 2 servers, 3 routers, 1 ISP router)

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Cisco Packet Tracer**
- **Static Routing**
- **RIPng (IPv6 Routing)**
- **Subnetting & VLSM**
- **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**
- **IPv4 & IPv6 Addressing**

---

## 🧩 Network Features

- 📍 WAN connections between HQ and branch offices
- 🔒 Secure design using basic ACLs and router passwords
- 📡 Dual-stack (IPv4 & IPv6) configuration for all routers and hosts
- 🖧 Two dedicated servers for DNS and Web services
- 📊 Documented IP addressing plan, device configurations, and network diagram

---

## 📌 Project Deliverables

- ✅ Full network topology and architecture
- ✅ Cisco Packet Tracer simulation (.pkt file)
- ✅ IP Addressing Plan (IPv4 & IPv6)
- ✅ Device configurations and startup scripts
- ✅ Diagram and documentation
